	<h1><b>1ST WEEK OF USERDES Class</h1><br>
	Last week was fun because it was the first the first meeting with Ms. Jen, and she welcomes us happily by starting to introduce herself in a friendly tone. I like the way how she approaches us that made us comfortable with her. <br>
	<br>
	In terms of academics, she gave a task to write up and make an introduction about ourselves. Next task is about our favorite app and she made us present in front of the class. Because of that presentation, we got ideas from each other that there are other apps that is useful. Ms. Jen thought us writing is important in designing whether it’s an app or a website because your content is the most important than design. Even if it looks presentable, but your contents are not enough or nonsense it is not worthy of people’s attention. <br>
	<br>
	I hope that throughout the term, I will learn a lot about designing an application or website that will help me in the future. I also expect that Ms. Jen will not change because I’m comfortable with her specially in presenting because she let’s us speak in Tagalog or English. </b>
