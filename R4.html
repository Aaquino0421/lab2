	<h1><b>R4: User Interface</h1> <br>
	Creating a user interface gave me a hard time since we still didn’t finalize what our application is. I find it hard because I still don’t have any idea on what it will looked like even though some of the features where given to us. <br>
	<br>
	It is hard for me to create a user interface without a proper knowledge on what application we will be having because I don’t know what the user needs. I still don’t have an idea on what other features that we will be needing since we were not still sure on the target audiences that we want to help. I think it is very important to know first the need of your target audience in able for you to create an effective user interface that users can use without them having a hard time. Though I enjoy making a user interface since I am freely to play with colors and what other buttons that I want. I think it also helped me to visualize what out application will look like and how it will work for the users.<br>  
	<br>
	Making a user interface maybe hard at first but I think it will be easier when you know exactly what the needs of the users and how you want your application can help them. I hope that these days we can create an effective user interface for our target audiences.</b>
