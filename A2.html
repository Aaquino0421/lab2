	<h1><b>MY FAVORITE APPLICATION</h1><br>
	I have this game in my phone that I always play when I’m bored or when I have free time. This game is free to play or you can choose to pay real money for extra items. Internet/mobile data is required for you to play. The player’s goal is to level up their fame and reputation, starting on the E-list and rising to A-list by gaining fans. <br>
	<br>
	I like it because in this game it can be whoever I want by styling it.  You can interact with one another by choosing on what you want to say or do. You can adopt a baby, buy clothes and stuffs for your house or for your partner and your baby. And also, you can travel in different countries. Players can gain more fans by booking modelling jobs, acting jobs, photoshoots, club appearances and going on dates. Every job/tasks cost energy, which refill overtime and it also has time duration. When the time is finished, you will earn money and gain more fans to increase your celebrity ranking, but you can also lose your fans when you don’t get enough stars.​ </b>
