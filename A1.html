	<h1><b>INTRODUCE YOURSELF</h1><br>
	Hi! I'm Alexis Aquino but you can call me Alex. I'm 19 years old and I live at 820 I. Santos St. Malibay, Pasay City. I graduated senior high school from Sta. Clara Parish School. I'm taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology - specialized in Mobile Internet in Asia Pacific College. I am a member in APC Dance Company and Junior Philippine Computer Society - APC.<br>
	<br>
	I like to dance, travelling, watching movies on Netflix, take photos, play badminton and volleyball. I also like to try adventurous things. I really don't like to eat vegetables. I'm a picky person when it comes to food.<br> 
	<br>
	I spent my summer mostly on dancing. I attended dance workshops and performed in a recital. Two weeks ago, me and my friends decided to do a photo shoot just for fun and also for their future portfolio. It was tiring but we had fun. <br>
	<br>
	I'm feeling down lately because I can't forget what happened when I was in senior high school. I was pushed by my ex and because of that accident, it broke my left leg. It really affected me specially on dancing. It's really hard to dance when there is a limitation specially to me because I can't do some steps that can hurt my left leg. I really need to be careful but it hinders me to give my best in dancing that is why I don't feel any improvements in me.<br>
	<br>
	My expectations from this class is to be fun and productive. And for the professor, I hope that she is considerate and understanding specially to students that canâ€™t cope up easily. And also accepts opinion.</b>
