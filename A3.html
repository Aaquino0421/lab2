		<h1><b>1000 FLOOR ELEVATOR</h1><br>
		Assuming that designing a thousand floor elevator will be a hard job to do. It will consume time for everyone to get to their floor, if there is only a single-decker elevator. Letâ€™s divide the elevator by 10 and each of it has 100 floors. There are 100 floors each elevator and each elevator can hold around 50 persons.<br>
		<br>
		In each elevator there will be seats, internet connection and it also plays music to help with all the waiting.  A touchscreen button where you will touch the floor # where you want to go. There will be 2 buttons for door open and close. Also, there are 2 buttons for emergencies; the alarm button to send a message to the operator and also in the phone.</b>
