	<h1><b>R3: First Web Application using Github and Heroku</h1><br>
	Making my first web application was hard because I don’t' have enough knowledge in this field. Although I know some of the basic html rules, I still thought it isn’t enough. I’m slowly learning and adapting to html codes. So far, I find it interesting and enjoying at the same time. My knowledge in IT is slowly widening because of the professor’s help. This might be a big challenge for me, but I do believe that I can be able to learn more and possibly be able to master other codes.<br>
	<br>
	Throughout the process, I found out that Sublime software is easier to understand than doing html application using notepad. I like how user friendly the software is especially for beginners like me. Creating a repository using Github and was very convenient and useful it has features where you can view,edit, and delete repositories anytime and anywhere. It is very convenient especially to people like me who isn’t always at home because of training. Heroku on the other hand, easier because you just have to connect your Github account and you can upload your files in there with ease.<br>
	<br>
	I think Github and Heroku are revolutionary software not only because they can store huge amounts of data and does not require to bring external storage devices but also, because of its convenience to its users. I think that the creator of this software does not only think about the importance of the software to its user but also, they thought about the convenience of their software to its user especially nowadays not all people works in an office, some are freelancers where they need an immediate place to edit document and that I think is the best part of this software.</b>
